The pages in coloring notebooks contain different adult coloring pages. Students take notes in notebooks, and studies suggest that the act of writing (as opposed to typing) improves learning.\\n\\nNotebook pages can be recycled via standard paper recycling. Recycled notebooks are available, differing in recycled percentage and paper quality.\\n\\n## Electronic successors\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSince the late 20th century, many attempts have been made to integrate the simplicity of a notebook with the editing, searching, and communication capacities of computers through the development of note taking software. [...] Laptop computers began to be called notebooks when they reached a small size in the mid-1990s. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) came next, integrating small liquid crystal displays with a touch-sensitive layer to input graphics and written text. Later on, this role was taken over by smartphones and tablets.\\n\\nDigital paper combines the simplicity of a traditional pen and notebook with digital storage and interactivity. By printing an invisible dot pattern on the notebook paper and using a pen with a built in infrared camera the written text can be transferred to a laptop, mobile phone or back office for storage and processing.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n[edit]',\n",

       "AIMessage(content='**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem‑solving, perception, language understanding, and decision‑making.\\n\\n### Core Ideas\\n\\n| Concept | What It Means |\\n|---------|----------------|\\n| **Machine Learning (ML)** | Algorithms that improve their performance automatically by learning from data (e.g., classification, regression). |\\n| **Deep Learning** | A subset of ML that uses multi‑layered neural networks to model complex patterns (e.g., image and speech recognition). |\\n| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | Techniques that enable computers to understand, generate, and interact with human language (e.g., chatbots, translation). |\\n| **Computer Vision** | Methods for interpreting visual information from images or video (e.g., object detection, facial recognition). |\\n| **Reinforcement Learning** | Agents learn optimal actions through trial‑and‑error interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties. |\\n| **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning** | Formal ways to encode facts about the world and draw logical conclusions (e.g., expert systems). |\\n\\n### Types of AI\\n\\n| Category | Description | Example |\\n|----------|-------------|---------|\\n| **Narrow (Weak) AI** | Designed for a specific task; outperforms humans in that domain but lacks general understanding. | Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation engines. |\\n| **General (Strong) AI** | Hypothetical AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across any task like a human. | Not yet realized; research goal. |\\n| **Artificial Superintelligence** | AI that surpasses human intelligence in all areas. | Purely speculative at this point. |\\n\\n### Brief History (Highlights)\\n\\n| Era | Milestones |\\n|-----|------------|\\n| **1950s–60s** | Alan Turing proposes the “Turing Test”; early programs like the Logic Theorist. |\\n| **1970s–80s** | Expert systems (e.g., MYCIN) dominate AI research; knowledge‑based approaches. |\\n| **1990s** | Statistical methods and machine learning gain traction; IBM’s Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov (1997). |\\n| **2000s** | Big data and improved computing power enable practical ML applications. |\\n| **2010s** | Deep learning breakthroughs (AlexNet 2012) spark rapid advances in vision, speech, and NLP. |\\n| **2020s** | Large language models (GPT‑3/4, PaLM, LLaMA) demonstrate impressive conversational and generative abilities. |\\n\\n### Everyday Applications\\n\\n- **Virtual assistants** (Siri, Google Assistant) – speech recognition & NLP.\\n- **Recommendation systems** – Netflix, Amazon, Spotify.\\n- **Healthcare** – disease diagnosis, drug discovery, medical imaging analysis.\\n- **Finance** – fraud detection, algorithmic trading, credit scoring.\\n- **Transportation** – autonomous vehicles, traffic optimization.\\n- **Manufacturing** – predictive maintenance, robotics, quality inspection.\\n- **Creative tools** – image generation (DALL·E, Stable Diffusion), music composition, code assistance.\\n\\n### How AI Works (Simplified Workflow)\\n\\n1. **Data Collection** – Gather relevant data (images, text, sensor readings, etc.).\\n2. **Pre‑processing** – Clean, normalize, and possibly label the data.\\n3. **Model Selection** – Choose an algorithm/architecture (e.g., decision tree, CNN, transformer).\\n4. **Training** – Feed data to the model; adjust internal parameters to minimize error.\\n5. **Evaluation** – Test the model on unseen data to measure performance (accuracy, F1‑score, etc.).\\n6. **Deployment** – Integrate the model into an application or service.\\n7. **Monitoring & Updating** – Continuously track performance and retrain as needed.\\n\\n### Common Misconceptions\\n\\n| Myth | Reality |\\n|------|----------|\\n| AI can think like a human. | Current AI lacks consciousness, self‑awareness, and true understanding. |\\n| More data always means better AI. | Quality, relevance, and bias mitigation matter as much as quantity. |\\n| AI will replace all jobs. | AI automates many tasks, but it also creates new roles and augments human work. |\\n| AI decisions are always objective. | Models inherit biases present in training data; careful auditing is essential. |\\n\\n### Ethical & Societal Considerations\\n\\n- **Bias & Fairness:** Ensuring models don’t discriminate against protected groups.\\n- **Privacy:** Handling personal data responsibly (e.g., GDPR, CCPA compliance).\\n- **Transparency:** Providing explainable AI (XAI) so users understand decisions.\\n- **Safety:** Preventing harmful behavior in autonomous systems.\\n- **Economic Impact:** Addressing workforce displacement and equitable benefit distribution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In a nutshell:** AI is the field that builds machines capable of performing intelligent tasks—learning from data, interpreting sensory input, communicating in natural language, and making decisions—often surpassing human performance in narrow domains. Its rapid evolution is reshaping industries, everyday life, and even how we think about intelligence itself.', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'The user asks: \"what is ai\".

       "AIMessage(content='**“Attention Is All You Need”** is the title of a landmark research paper published in 2017 by a team at Google Brain (Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,\\u202f…\\u202fand others). The paper introduced the **Transformer** model, which has become the dominant architecture for modern natural‑language‑processing (NLP) systems (BERT, GPT‑3/4, T5, etc.) and is now spreading to vision, speech, and many other domains.\\n\\nBelow is a concise overview of what the paper contains, why it mattered, and how the model works.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Problem the paper addresses\\n- **Sequence‑to‑sequence tasks** (e.g., machine translation) were traditionally handled with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) plus an attention mechanism.\\n- RNN‑based models process tokens **sequentially**, which limits parallelism and makes training slow, especially for long sequences.\\n- Even with attention, the recurrent backbone still imposes a step‑by‑step dependency.\\n\\n## 2. Core Idea\\n- **Replace recurrence entirely with self‑attention**.  \\n- Build a model that can look at every token in the input (or already‑generated output) at once, compute pairwise interactions, and do so **fully in parallel**.\\n\\n## 3. Architecture Overview\\n| Component | Description |\\n|-----------|-------------|\\n| **Input Embedding + Positional Encoding** | Tokens are turned into vectors (learned embeddings). Since the model has no recurrence, a sinusoidal positional encoding is added to give each position a unique signal. |\\n| **Encoder** | Stacked **N** identical layers (the original paper used N\\u202f=\\u202f6). Each layer consists of: <br>1️⃣ **Multi‑Head Self‑Attention** (allows the model to attend to different representation subspaces simultaneously). <br>2️⃣ **Position‑wise Feed‑Forward Network** (two linear layers with a ReLU in between). <br>Both sub‑layers have residual connections and layer‑norm. |\\n| **Decoder** | Also N identical layers. Each layer has three sub‑components: <br>1️⃣ **Masked Multi‑Head Self‑Attention** (prevents positions from attending to future tokens). <br>2️⃣ **Encoder‑Decoder Attention** (queries the encoder’s output). <br>3️⃣ **Position‑wise Feed‑Forward**. Same residual + layer‑norm pattern. |\\n| **Output Linear + Softmax** | Maps decoder outputs to a probability distribution over the target vocabulary. |\\n\\n### 3.1 Multi‑Head Self‑Attention (the heart of the model)\\n1. **Queries (Q), Keys (K), Values (V)** are linear projections of the same input (or of the encoder output in the decoder‑encoder attention).  \\n2. **Scaled dot‑product attention**:  \\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\\\text{softmax}\\\\!\\\\Big(\\\\frac{QK^{\\\\top}}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}}\\\\Big) V\\n   \\\\]  \\n   where \\\\(d_k\\\\) is the dimensionality of the keys (scaling prevents large dot‑product values from saturating the softmax).  \\n3. **Multiple heads**: the above operation is performed in parallel on different learned linear projections, producing several “attention heads”. Their outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed again. This lets the model capture different types of relationships (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic) simultaneously.\\n\\n### 3.2 Positional Encoding\\nBecause the attention mechanism itself is permutation‑invariant, the authors inject position information using a deterministic sinusoidal function:\\n\\\\[\\nPE_{(pos,2i)} = \\\\sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}}),\\\\quad\\nPE_{(pos,2i+1)} = \\\\cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})\\n\\\\]\\nThese encodings can be added to the token embeddings and allow the model to learn relative positions.\\n\\n## 4. Training Details (as reported in the paper)\\n| Aspect | Setting |\\n|--------|---------|\\n| **Datasets** | WMT 2014 English‑German (≈4.5\\u202fM sentence pairs) and English‑French (≈36\\u202fM pairs). |\\n| **Model size** | Base model: \\\\(d_{\\\\text{model}}=512\\\\), 8 attention heads, 6 encoder + 6 decoder layers → ~65\\u202fM parameters. |\\n| **Optimization** | Adam optimizer (β₁=0.9,\\u202fβ₂=0.98), learning‑rate schedule with warm‑up (increase for first 4000 steps, then decay). |\\n| **Regularization** | Dropout (0.1) on attention weights and feed‑forward sub‑layers; label smoothing (ε=0.1). |\\n| **Results** | BLEU scores: EN‑DE 28.4 (vs. 24.6 for the previous best); EN‑FR 41.8 (vs. 39.2). Training was **8× faster** than comparable RNN‑based models because of full parallelism. |\\n\\n## 5. Key Contributions & Why They Matter\\n1. **Elimination of recurrence** – enables massive parallel computation on GPUs/TPUs, dramatically speeding up training.\\n2. **Self‑attention as a universal sequence model** – shows that attention alone can capture long‑range dependencies without the need for convolutions or recurrences.\\n3. **Multi‑head design** – a simple yet powerful way to let the model attend to information from different representation subspaces.\\n4. **Scalable architecture** – the same design can be deepened or widened (more layers, more heads) to achieve better performance, paving the way for later “large‑scale” models.\\n5. **General applicability** – although introduced for translation, the Transformer quickly became the backbone for many downstream tasks (language modeling, question answering, summarization, etc.) and even for non‑text domains (Vision Transformers, speech, protein folding).\\n\\n## 6. Impact & Follow‑ups\\n- **BERT (2018)**, **GPT series (2018‑2023)**, **T5**, **RoBERTa**, **XLNet**, and countless others are all built on the Transformer encoder or decoder (or a combination).\\n- **Vision Transformers (ViT, 2020)** apply the same self‑attention mechanism to image patches.\\n- The paper sparked an entire research ecosystem: efficient attention variants (Sparse‑Transformer, Longformer, Performer), multilingual models (mBART, mT5), and scaling laws studies.\\n- It has been cited **> 30\\u202fk** times (as of early 2026) and is considered one of the most influential deep‑learning papers ever published.\\n\\n## 7. TL;DR Summary\\n- **“Attention Is All You Need”** proposes the **Transformer**, a sequence‑to‑sequence model that replaces RNNs/CNNs with **pure self‑attention**.\\n- The model processes all tokens in parallel, learns relationships via multi‑head scaled dot‑product attention, and adds positional encodings to retain order.\\n- It achieves state‑of‑the‑art translation performance while being **much faster to train**.\\n- Its design became the foundation for virtually all modern large‑language models and many other AI systems.\\n\\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into any component (e.g., the math of scaled dot‑product attention, the exact training schedule, or how later models modify the original architecture), just let me know!', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'The user asks: \"What is in attention is all you need?\" Probably they mean \"What is \\'Attention Is All You Need\\'?\" They want an explanation of the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\".

We discuss the key design decisions that have shaped its development, and examine the software architecture and its core components. We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for solving a problem in condensed matter physics on a quantum computer that serves to highlight some of Qiskit's capabilities, for example the representation and optimization of circuits at various abstraction levels, its scalability and retargetability to new gates, and the use of quantum-classical computations via dynamic circuits. Lastly, we discuss some of the ecosystem of tools and plugins that extend Qiskit for various tasks, and the future ahead.\", \"score\": 0.90830135}, {\"title\": \"[2407.16296] Quantum Computing for Climate Resilience ...\", \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16296\", \"content\": \"We gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and all contributors.

[...] At the start of 2024, we introduced ImageFX, a new generative AI tool that creates images from text prompts, and MusicFX, a tool for creating up-to-70-second audio clips also based on text prompts. At I/O, we shared an early preview of MusicFX DJ, a tool that helps bring the joy of live music creation to more people. In October, we collaborated with Jacob Collier on making MusicFX DJ simpler to use, especially for new or aspiring musicians. And we updated our music AI toolkit Music AI Sandbox, and evolved our Dream Track experiment which allowed U.S. creators to explore a range of genres and prompts that generate instrumental soundtracks with powerful text-to-music models. [...] In December 2024, we released the first models in our Gemini 2.0 experimental series — AI models designed for the agentic era. First out of the gate was Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse model, followed by prototypes from the frontiers of our agentic research including: an updated Project Astra, which explores the capabilities of a universal AI assistant; Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension; and Jules, an AI-powered code agent. We're looking forward to bringing Gemini 2.0’s powerful capabilities to our flagship products — in Search, we’ve already started testing in AI Overviews, which are now used by over a billion people to ask new types of questions.\", \"score\": 0.91813606}, {\"title\": \"AI 2024 in review: The 10 most notable AI stories of the year\", \"url\": \"https://iot-analytics.com/ai-2024-10-most-notable-stories/\", \"content\": \"On February 14, 2024, Microsoft announced that state-sponsored hackers from Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran have been using tools from OpenAI—which Microsoft significantly backs—to improve their hacking campaigns. Microsoft stated that the groups used AI differently. For example, the Russian GRU generally used large language models (LLMs) to research “various satellite and radar technologies that may pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine.” Meanwhile, North Korean hackers reportedly used LLMs to generate content intended for spear-phishing campaigns, and Iranian hackers used the models to write more convincing emails.\\n\\n### 2. Most impactful AI-related regulation: EU AI Act [...] Major LLM advancement projects miss their targets. In September 2024, OpenAI wrapped up the initial round of training for a new LLM (referred to as Orion internally) that it hoped would vastly surpass its previous models, much like how OpenAI’s GPT-4o (released May 2024) was considered a massive step up from GPT-4 Turbo. However, the model has reportedly thus far failed to live up to expectations and is not considered as big of a step up from current models as GPT-4o was from GPT-4 Turbo, or GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\\n\\nOpenAI is not alone in this apparent disappointment, though. LLM providers Google and Anthropic also appear to have not met expectations for their anticipated Gemini and Claude model updates, with new releases delayed for them as well. [...] Further, in October 2024, OpenAI released ChatGPT Search, enabling ChatGPT to search the web and allowing users to search for information via the ChatGPT interface and with source citations. Finally, in December 2024, OpenAI and Google released video generation capabilities in their offerings, named Sora (based on DALL-E 3) and Veo2, respectively.\\n\\n### 8.

Again, lots of work went into this in 2024. In October, Meta released updates to its Llama AI model that are as much as four times faster and 56% smaller than their precursors, enabling sophisticated AI features on devices as small as smartphones. And Nvidia released its Nemotron-Mini-4B Instruct small language model (SLM), which gets VRAM usage down to about 2GB for far faster speeds than LLMs.\\n\\nSmaller models aren’t only more nimble: they’re also more energy-efficient than LLMs—and more affordable, too. That in turn makes them more widely accessible. All of this aligns well with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. [...] From RAGs to AI richesAI systems need relevant data to solve problems effectively. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides that by giving systems access to contextually significant information instead of broad, unfocused data sets. On its own, RAG has been found to reduce AI hallucinations and outperform alternative approaches such as long-context transformers and fine-tuning. Combining RAG with fine-tuning produces even better results.\\n\\nAnthropic announced its own spin on RAG earlier this fall with “contextual retrieval”—said to make information retrieval more successful—and a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting AI assistants to data systems in a reliable and scalable way. [...] AI Trends in 2024\\n\\nAI Advances by Leaps and BoundsOur previous AI Pulse was dedicated mostly to agentic AI—for good reason. Autonomous, cooperative machine-based problem solving is widely seen as an essential step along the path to artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Continuing from these efforts, in 2024, I hope to see increasing united efforts from governments, industry and academia worldwide on forging an effective action plan that includes policy regulation and [...] AI has enabled striking scientific and technological breakthroughs for previously intractable problems. At UC Berkeley, researchers developed AI-powered tools that helped a paralyzed woman speak with a digital avatar and informed policymakers for a global plastics treaty negotiation.

These new “reasoning” models produce better results by using reinforcement learning (RL) to employ structured chains of thought and by spending more time and computing power on a query. Other AI companies are beginning to follow suit, with Google and Chinese tech giant Alibaba releasing their own reasoning models. Not to be outdone, at the end of their seasonal “shipmas,” OpenAI announced their next generation o3 models, promising massive gains on hard benchmarks like ARC-AGI and positioning this as potentially the next major frontier for popular development. [...] Perhaps the one exception to the rule is Anthropic. In a blog post published this October, Anthropic continued to make the case for targeted regulation of the AI industry, writing that “Governments should urgently take action on AI policy in the next eighteen months.”\\n\\nMore than anything, the case that Anthropic now stands alone as an industry voice in favor of regulation signals a marked shift since the beginning of the year.\\n\\nAs AI continues to shape our future, the trends in 2024 reveal a fluid landscape. AI companies aren’t just reinventing tech, they’re reinventing themselves, changing their policies and fundamentally changing their missions. [...] Ever since the debut of ChatGPT, the race to release the next important AI model has been the hallmark of the industry. Leading developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic have been in a constant cycle of releasing increasingly larger and more powerful models, with the aim of pushing the boundaries of what AI can do. Anthropic released multiple generations of the Claude family of models over the course of a single year. At the same time, Meta launched Llama 1, 2, and 3 in just 15 months. These models all saw massively improved general performance by following the “scaling laws,” using more and higher-quality data, and training using more compute.\", \"score\": 0.88420963}]\n",
